\title{Install system dependencies that Rtools (and in turn packrat) require to build packages with compiled code on Windows}
\usage{
setup_rtools_pkgs(extsoft_dir = "c:/extsoft")

\arguments{
\item{extsoft_dir}{The directory you would like the external software to be installed in}
}
\value{
Updated folder structure
}
\description{
This function install windows system dependencies that are required for building packages with compiled code. In particular it installs the local323.zip and curl-7.40.0.zip from the R tools goodies section of cran: https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/goodies/multilib/ and makes them available to Rtools. \cr \cr
}
\details{
The function extracts the zips to a folder (default is c:/extsoft) and creates a makevars file that points rtools to the packages. The default location of this is ~/.R./makevars. Usually ~ is My Documents. \cr

Without this setup you will find that packages such as XML, stringi, RCurl will throw errors when compiling (usually when restoring old versions with packrat).
